1. Form functionality: If I'm creating radio buttons to choose one option but there's also a write-in option, how do I make it
either/or?


2. Okay I have got a lot of my capybara test issues worked out, I'm finally lining up my rspec errors with the functionality problems
I'm experiencing through shotgun, that I can assign new titles and landmarks to a new figure but can't get them to come in when I click the buttons

Start out by creating a new figure, landmark and title.
Then, add that landmark and title to the figures collection
  of landmarks and titles respectively.

when a user creates or edits a figure, they should also be able
to select or create a new landmark and/or title to associate to
that figure. In other words, the form for a new figure and the form
to edit a figure should allow the user to select from existing landmarks
and title and create new landmarks and titles to associate to the figure

Our client doesn't really care about titles and we won't be required to
build a titles controller or to have any titles views. New titles will
only get created in the context of creating or editing a figure.
